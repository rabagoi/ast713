    "A CCD detector at the focal plane of a 1-m diameter telescope records the image of a certain star. Due to the blurring effect of the atmosphere, the light from the star is spread over a circular area of R pixels. The total number of photoelectrons accumulated in this area from the star is $N_{star}$. Light from the sky produces $n_{sky}$ photoelectrons for each pixel in the same exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Calculate the signal-to-noise ratio S/N of the photometric measurement of the star (i.e. the ratio of counts from the star to the uncertainty in the measurement). Assume Poisson statistics, so that the \"noise\" is the square root of the total counts from all sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) The same star is observed with the same exposure time, but with a 10-m diameter telescope. The larger telescope has a larger light gethering area, but also has 3 times better seeing, spreading the star's light onto a circle of size R/3 instead. Find the S/N ratio in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Assuming the star and sky are not variable, find the dependence of S/N on the exposure time, t, in two limiting cases: the counts from the star are much greater than counts in the sky, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Based on the results of (c), by what factor does the exposure time with the 1-m telescope need to be increased to reach the S/N ratio of the 10-m telescope, for each of the limiting cases?\n",
